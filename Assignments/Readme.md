#### Assignment 1: 
This assignment will help you discover how to understand your organization’s data so that you can figure out how to properly build a data warehouse around it.

#### Assignment 2: 
Introduce you to products and services in the data warehousing space and Learn how to read through marketing materials and determine product offerings

#### Assignment 3: 
The goal of this process is to turn functional business requirements into dimensional data warehouse (DDS) specifications based on the Kimball technical architecture.

#### Assignment 4: 
In this assignment we will complete the technical designs for our DDS by completing the specifics of the fact and dimension table implementations

#### Assignment 5: 
Implemented the physical model (database tables, keys and constraints) for your Details Dimensional-Modeling workbook, and then test that model by performing an initial data load using SQL Queries, a fairly common practice in dimensional model development.

#### Assignment 6: 
The purpose of this assignment is to give you a clear picture of how ETL development is done using actual ETL tooling. The tool we will use is called SQL Server Integration Services, or SSIS. This assignment, in two parts, aims to give you a feel for how the concepts you’ve learned in class apply in a real-world scenario with actual ETL tooling, instead of SQL.

#### Assignment 7:
This assignment continues where the previous assignment left off by demonstrating how to load your staged data into the data warehouse using an ETL tool. The tool we will use is called SQL Server Integration Services or SSIS

****Note: Assignment 8 was a part of 7

#### Assignment 9:
We’ll start with MOLAP development using SQL Server Analysis Services, or SSAS. This will help you understand how the semantic model, where we add additional meaning to our data, helps support business intelligence. After you build your MOLAP cube, you’ll visualize and explore the data with a variety of business intelligence tools such as PowerBi to create interactive reports, charts, maps, and dashboards.
